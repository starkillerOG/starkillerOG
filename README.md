## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a small developer that loves to use and support Open Source Software. My biggest interest is in home automation and specifically Home Assistant.

I am currently code owner of multiple official HomeAssistant integration; for instance the reolink, motion_blinds, netgear, denonavr, xiaomi_miio and goodwe integrations.

I am actively working together and in contact with Reolink, and coulisse BV (motion blinds), but are in no way associated with them.

If you appreciate what I am doing and want to support the further development of my Home Assistant integrations, please consider sponsering using any of the methods below:
